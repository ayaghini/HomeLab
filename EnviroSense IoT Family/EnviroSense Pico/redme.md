EnviroSense Pico

I worked on this back in 2020 and managed to get it to work, back rhen I used mqtt to publish air quality and then use node red installed on my raspberry pi to log data to an influx db and used grafana to display them. 

I am niw revisiting this project to update it, i dont feel like setting up all grafana, influx and node red anymore, instead i am tking the home assitant path now. I now that the previous aproach was really good for learning pusposes and home assitance is a laze one but my goal now is to gethese to work. you can find the old one under archive folder.
