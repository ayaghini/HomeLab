# ESPHome IKEA Air Quality Sensor Setup

I originally bought this sensor back in 2021 but never finished the project. Now I finally have some time to get back to it.  

I followed this helpful video:

### Using ESPHome
It seems like the most common approach in the community is to use **ESPHome**, so Iâ€™m giving that a try. Most of the setup is straightforward, but for the **BME680** youâ€™ll need to follow the BSEC2 guide above.

### Using ESP-01
I had a few **ESP-01** modules lying around, so I used one for this project.  
Keep in mind:
- Very basic module with only **2 usable GPIOs**  
- Operates only at **3.3V**  
- Both `3.3V` and `EN` pins must be tied to **3.3V**  

For **IÂ²C connections**, I used this reference:

Configuration in ESPHome:
```yaml
i2c:
  sda: GPIO2
  scl: GPIO0
```

### Connecting to the IKEA Sensor
I used the **Rx pin** on the ESP-01 to connect to the IKEA **REST pin**.  

Configuration in ESPHome:
```yaml
uart:
  rx_pin: GPIO3
  baud_rate: 9600
```
