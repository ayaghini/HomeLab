# Successful Proxmox Migration Attempt

After multiple failed attempts, I finally found a working approach for migrating to Proxmox VE. The guide that helped me the most (though not entirely) is this one:

ðŸ‘‰ [Advanced Migration Techniques to Proxmox VE](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Advanced_Migration_Techniques_to_Proxmox_VE)

## Clonezilla Steps and Adjustments

One part of the guide that seems outdated or has changed is the process of using Clonezilla. For that, I followed this video tutorial:

ðŸ“º [Clonezilla Migration Guide + VM Setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fP-ilAo_Ks)  

I also recommend watching the beginning of the video for setting up the VM properly.

### Differences from the Video Guide

The only things I did differently from the video were:

- I **downloaded the VirtIO drivers ISO** separately.
- When creating the VM, I **attached the VirtIO drivers ISO** as an additional ISO.

These changes ensured a smooth migration process.

This approach finally worked for me. Hopefully, it helps others facing similar migration challenges!
